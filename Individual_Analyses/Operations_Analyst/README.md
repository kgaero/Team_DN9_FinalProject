# Final Project - DIVE Analysis as Operational Excellence Analysis

## Option B: Retail Chain Transformation

Client: Legacy retail chain losing market share
Dataset: Store performance and customer data


This document presents an in-depth operational excellence analysis using the DIVE framework.
It draws from data outputs (branch transactions, hours, sales) and Gemini recommendations.

## Discover: Process Efficiency, Resource Utilization, Operational Metrics

The initial phase focuses on uncovering baseline performance.


## Executive Summary
This report presents an extensive analysis of a legacy retail chain’s operational performance, 
customer behavior, and revenue distribution based on the provided dataset outputs. 
The primary goal is to restructure operations to compete with digital disruptors while optimizing 
process efficiency, resource utilization, and customer engagement. 
The analysis integrates transaction patterns, revenue contributions, customer segmentation, 
product line performance, and time-based trends to provide actionable recommendations. 

The report focuses on four key pillars:
1. Discover – Identifying inefficiencies and underutilized opportunities.
2. Investigate – Understanding drivers of performance and bottlenecks.
3. Validate – Testing operational improvement hypotheses.
4. Extend – Building a roadmap for sustainable optimization.

Our findings reveal that while the retail chain maintains relatively balanced customer traffic 
throughout the week, certain hours and product lines significantly outperform others, creating 
opportunities for targeted promotions and improved resource allocation. 
High-margin product categories and peak transaction windows can be leveraged for maximizing 
profitability, while underperforming segments can be addressed with strategic interventions.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of sales transactions containing details such as invoice ID, branch, city, 
customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, sales, date, time, payment method, 
cost of goods sold (COGS), gross margin percentage, gross income, rating, and month.

This rich dataset enables multi-dimensional analysis, providing insight into sales patterns 
across demographic segments, time intervals, product categories, and payment preferences.

## Key Tables and Insights
### 1. Customer Type Distribution
| Customer Type | Transactions (%) | Revenue (%) |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Member        | 50.1             | 50.3        |
| Normal        | 49.9             | 49.7        |

Insight: The distribution between Member and Normal customers is nearly even, suggesting that 
both groups are equally important to revenue generation. Loyalty programs should be tailored 
to encourage repeat purchases from Members while simultaneously converting Normal customers 
into Members to boost retention rates.

Recommendation: Implement segmented loyalty incentives that reward Members with exclusive 
discounts and early product access while offering Normal customers targeted promotions 
to drive sign-ups.

### 2. Hourly Transaction Share by Customer Type
| Hour | Member (%) | Normal (%) |
|------|------------|------------|
| 10   | 10.27      | 10.04      |
| 11   | 8.93       | 9.11       |
| 12   | 8.89       | 9.17       |
| 13   | 10.11      | 10.55      |
| 14   | 8.35       | 8.42       |
| 15   | 10.07      | 10.23      |
| 16   | 7.89       | 7.50       |
| 17   | 7.34       | 7.39       |
| 18   | 9.58       | 9.06       |
| 19   | 11.11      | 11.24      |
| 20   | 7.47       | 7.29       |

Insight: Transactions peak during late morning (10 AM - 1 PM) and evening hours (6 PM - 8 PM). 
This aligns with consumer shopping habits before work, during lunch breaks, and after work hours.

Recommendation: Adjust staffing schedules to align with peak hours, ensuring faster service 
and improved customer experience during high-traffic periods. Introduce time-bound offers 
during slower hours to spread foot traffic more evenly.

### 3. Weekday Transaction Share by Customer Type
| Day       | Member (%) | Normal (%) |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Monday    | 14.26      | 14.19      |
| Tuesday   | 14.37      | 14.37      |
| Wednesday | 14.23      | 14.13      |
| Thursday  | 14.32      | 14.50      |
| Friday    | 14.08      | 14.15      |
| Saturday  | 14.36      | 14.35      |
| Sunday    | 14.38      | 14.30      |

Insight: Transaction distribution is remarkably stable across the week, indicating 
consistent daily customer engagement.

Recommendation: Since no single day dominates, weekend-specific promotions should focus 
on increasing average transaction value (ATV), while weekday promotions could aim at 
driving incremental visits from local working professionals.

## Operational Efficiency Opportunities
From the provided outputs, several operational improvement opportunities emerge:
- **Product Affinity Optimization**: Introduce bundled deals for top-affinity products 
to encourage cross-selling.
- **Targeted Promotions**: Launch promotions aligned with peak transaction hours to 
maximize conversion rates.
- **Staff Allocation**: Reallocate staffing resources based on hourly and daily transaction 
patterns to reduce wait times and improve service.
- **Inventory Management**: Synchronize stock replenishment schedules with demand peaks 
to avoid stockouts and overstock situations.

## Extended Recommendations
1. **Digital Transformation** – Develop a robust e-commerce platform integrated with 
loyalty programs, enabling omnichannel sales and personalized offers.
2. **Data-Driven Decision Making** – Invest in analytics infrastructure to monitor 
real-time sales and customer behavior, enabling agile responses to demand shifts.
3. **Customer Retention** – Implement AI-driven churn prediction models to proactively 
engage at-risk customers with personalized incentives.
4. **Operational Automation** – Leverage automation tools for demand forecasting, 
inventory restocking, and workforce scheduling.
5. **Employee Training** – Equip staff with training in upselling, cross-selling, 
and customer engagement to maximize revenue per interaction.

## Conclusion
The data indicates that this retail chain has strong fundamentals in customer engagement 
and consistent traffic throughout the week. However, strategic adjustments in promotions, 
staffing, and product bundling can enhance both revenue and customer satisfaction.
By focusing on operational excellence and leveraging analytics-driven insights, 
the chain can strengthen its market position against digital disruptors while improving 
profit margins and brand loyalty.
