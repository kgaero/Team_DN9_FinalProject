# Final Project - DIVE Analysis as Operational Excellence Analysis

## Option B: Retail Chain Transformation

Client: Legacy retail chain losing market share
Dataset: Store performance and customer data


This document presents an in-depth operational excellence analysis using the DIVE framework.
It draws from data outputs (branch transactions, hours, sales) and Gemini recommendations.

## Discover: Process Efficiency, Resource Utilization, Operational Metrics

The initial phase focuses on uncovering baseline performance.

### 1. Process Efficiency  
From the transaction outputs and branch-level summaries:  

- **Peak hour inefficiency**: Sales and transactions peak at **13:00 and 19:00**, but throughput per transaction dips, suggesting stress on checkout capacity.  
- **Evening rush misalignment**: Resource coverage appears weaker in the 19:00 slot, creating potential bottlenecks.  
- **Consistency across mid-day**: Between **10:00–15:00**, process flow is more stable, indicating smoother operations.  

| Hour | Transactions | Total Sales | Avg Sale per Txn | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| 10:00 | 3426 | 58,332 | 17.0 | Stable throughput |
| 13:00 | 3507 | 58,415 | 16.7 | Midday peak |
| 15:00 | 3412 | 58,594 | 17.2 | Balanced |
| 19:00 | 3821 | 63,090 | 16.5 | Evening spike, strain visible |

**Insight:** The 19:00 peak shows the **highest traffic but lowest efficiency per transaction** (AOV dips). This is a sign of bottlenecks at checkout or staff coverage mismatch.  

---

### 2. Resource Utilization  
From the branch-level breakdown:  

- **Alex Branch dominates**: Generates the highest transactions and sales volume, but shows signs of throughput inefficiency at peak.  
- **Cairo Branch**: Slightly lower sales per transaction, potentially due to product mix skewed toward low-margin goods.  
- **Giza Branch**: Stronger balance between transactions and sales, indicating better per-resource utilization.  

| Branch | Transactions | Total Sales | Avg Sale per Txn | Efficiency Signal |
|--------|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Alex   | 17,337 | 287,148 | 16.6 | High volume, slightly low yield |
| Cairo  | 12,482 | 204,997 | 16.4 | Lower basket size |
| Giza   | 13,107 | 218,504 | 16.7 | Balanced performance |

**Insight:** Cairo may be underutilizing resources (same effort, lower yield), while Alex is overburdened during peak hours.  

---

### 3. Operational Metrics  
Key system-wide KPIs from the dataset:  

- **Average basket size**: ~1.9 items per transaction, relatively flat across branches.  
- **Sales per transaction**: Range 16.4–17.2, showing narrow dispersion (consistent pricing & promotions).  
- **Transaction growth**: Evening and mid-day peaks drive ~35% of daily sales volume.  

| Metric | Value | Observation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Basket Size | 1.9 items | Flat across branches — opportunity for cross-sell/upsell |
| Sales/Txn | 16.4 – 17.2 | Narrow band, suggests stable price architecture |
| Peak Share | 35% of daily | Concentrated in two windows (13:00, 19:00) |

**Insight:** Stability across operational metrics is good, but it also indicates **limited differentiation strategies** — no branch is standing out in customer yield.  


# 🔎 Investigate: Operational Factors and Bottlenecks  

The **Investigate** phase digs into *why* the observed inefficiencies exist, using branch comparisons, temporal patterns, and product-line margins.  

---

## 1. Root Causes Identified  

- **Staffing misalignment at peaks (Alex):**  
  Average ticket *drops −$0.49* during 13:00–19:00, suggesting long queues and incomplete baskets. Cairo actually improves (+$0.22), hinting that staffing coverage is stronger there.  

- **Checkout tender mix (Alex):**  
  Cash share increases **+1.1%** during peaks, slowing checkout speed. Cairo/Giza show <0.4% change, implying less impact.  

- **Margin trade-offs:**  
  Alex generates the **highest revenue (~$263K)** but lowest margin (**14.05%**). Giza is the opposite: lower revenue (~$149K) but highest margin (**20.36%**).  

- **Inventory timing (Alex):**  
  Dips in units/transaction for **Food & Beverages (−0.013)** and **Electronics (−0.010)** during peak hours suggest stock-outs or late replenishment.  

- **Product line leverage:**  
  Health & Beauty yields ~18.25% margin in Alex, but contribution to total sales share is not dominant. Strong potential to lift branch margins with better placement/bundling.

## 2. Supporting Metrics  

| Branch | Revenue ($) | Avg Ticket ($) | Margin % | Peak Δ Avg Ticket | Cash Share Δ | Key Signals |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Alex   | 263,192 | 22.70 | 14.05% | −0.49 | +1.1% | High rev, weak peak perf, slow checkout |
| Cairo  | 257,839 | 23.00 | 13.98% | +0.22 | +0.4% | Stable perf, resilient peaks |
| Giza   | 149,576 | 13.90 | 20.36% | −0.12 | +0.2% | Low rev, high margin |

## 3. Testable Hypotheses  

1. **Staffing Alignment (Alex)**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Adding staff 16:00–19:00 increases throughput and average ticket.  
   - *Metrics:* Transactions/hour, avg ticket, queue length.  
   - *Test:* Two-sample t-test or OLS regression.  
   - *Decision Rule:* If avg ticket ↑ >5% and queue time <3 min, scale staffing change.  

2. **E-Wallet Adoption (Alex)**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Incentivizing e-wallet use reduces service time.  
   - *Metrics:* % e-wallet share, transaction time, throughput.  
   - *Test:* t-test on throughput before vs after promotion.  
   - *Decision Rule:* If e-wallet share ↑ 2–3% and throughput ↑ 5–10%, scale promotion.  

3. **Planogram Transfer (Giza)**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Replicating Alex’s Health & Beauty planogram in Giza raises margin mix.  
   - *Metrics:* Health & Beauty sales and margin contribution.  
   - *Test:* Before/after t-test or ANOVA on product-line sales.  
   - *Decision Rule:* If margin ↑ ≥2 points, roll out to other branches.  

4. **Inventory Timing (Alex)**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Earlier replenishment of Food & Beverages + Electronics boosts units/txn.  
   - *Metrics:* Units/txn during 13:00–19:00, OOS rate.  
   - *Test:* t-test on units/txn peak vs off-peak after change.  
   - *Decision Rule:* If units/txn ↑ ≥5% and OOS ↓, make replenishment permanent.

## 4. Targeted Experiments  

| Pilot | Branch | Intervention | Expected Outcome | KPIs | Guardrails |
|-------|--------|--------------|------------------|------|------------|
| Staffing boost | Alex | +2–3 staff at checkout (16:00–19:00) | Higher throughput & avg ticket | Txns/hr, Avg ticket | Queue <3min; stop if >5min |
| E-wallet promo | Alex | 5% discount/loyalty points for e-wallet at peak | Faster checkout, ↑ throughput | Txns/hr, E-wallet % | Guard avg ticket; stop if margin erodes |
| Planogram test | Giza | Health & Beauty placement/bundle pilot | ↑ share of high-margin line | Margin %, Line sales | Stop if no +2pt margin lift |
| Replenishment | Alex | Add F&B & Electronics deliveries at 14:00 | ↑ units/txn, fewer OOS | Units/txn, OOS rate | Halt if no gain or ↑ shrinkage |

---

## 5. Insights  

- **Revenue vs margin is a trade-off.** Alex proves high volume can still erode profitability without margin discipline.  
- **Bottlenecks compound at peaks.** Staffing gaps, slower tender mix, and stockouts all converge 13:00–19:00, especially in Alex.  
- **Giza’s high margin model** shows operational efficiency, but low revenue means growth must come from increasing traffic or replicating high-margin plays.  





## Executive Summary
This report presents an extensive analysis of a legacy retail chain’s operational performance, 
customer behavior, and revenue distribution based on the provided dataset outputs. 
The primary goal is to restructure operations to compete with digital disruptors while optimizing 
process efficiency, resource utilization, and customer engagement. 
The analysis integrates transaction patterns, revenue contributions, customer segmentation, 
product line performance, and time-based trends to provide actionable recommendations. 

The report focuses on four key pillars:
1. Discover – Identifying inefficiencies and underutilized opportunities.
2. Investigate – Understanding drivers of performance and bottlenecks.
3. Validate – Testing operational improvement hypotheses.
4. Extend – Building a roadmap for sustainable optimization.

Our findings reveal that while the retail chain maintains relatively balanced customer traffic 
throughout the week, certain hours and product lines significantly outperform others, creating 
opportunities for targeted promotions and improved resource allocation. 
High-margin product categories and peak transaction windows can be leveraged for maximizing 
profitability, while underperforming segments can be addressed with strategic interventions.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of sales transactions containing details such as invoice ID, branch, city, 
customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, tax, sales, date, time, payment method, 
cost of goods sold (COGS), gross margin percentage, gross income, rating, and month.

This rich dataset enables multi-dimensional analysis, providing insight into sales patterns 
across demographic segments, time intervals, product categories, and payment preferences.

## Key Tables and Insights
### 1. Customer Type Distribution
| Customer Type | Transactions (%) | Revenue (%) |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Member        | 50.1             | 50.3        |
| Normal        | 49.9             | 49.7        |

Insight: The distribution between Member and Normal customers is nearly even, suggesting that 
both groups are equally important to revenue generation. Loyalty programs should be tailored 
to encourage repeat purchases from Members while simultaneously converting Normal customers 
into Members to boost retention rates.
